[Applause] hello everyone today I'm going to tell you how to treat a patient who's seizing at home if you find a patient seizing first thing you have to do is keep him flat on the floor and see to it that he's not surrounded by any hard or sharp objects then you can keep a soft pillow or a blanket under his head then if he is vomiting keep the patient on a left lateral position or turn the patient towards one side so that he can breathe then what you're not supposed to do don't try to keep any object in the patient's mouth because it can injure the teeth or the jaw never try to give mouth to mouth respiration because the patient will start breathing after once the seizure stops then do not give any water or food when the patient is seizing and lastly do not try to stop the movements of the patient the patient will recover on its own after the seizure stops thank you

[Music] [Music] So today we are conducting ing nulls workshop at K Baner Hospitals in association with the semi board. The main intention of conducting this program is to enhance the skills of emergency doctors. This program helps them in many conditions especially when they in dilemma of diagnosis, dilemma in management of cases in dalma in disposion of cases. So in the same program we are going to teach about basics of ultrasound right from the selection of the probes then how to uh get acquaintance with the noology then we are going to teach about how to do chest ultra sonography then abdomen then cardiac then how to detect the DVTs then pulmonary thrombolism then protocols like rush protocol. So these are the things we are teaching in this n workshop. I hope this workshop helps all emergency fraternity to deal the case in a better way in all the ways like diagnosis then clinical management then proper dispersion of the case in patient. So this is how this program is going to help the emergency fraternity. [Music] I'm really happy with the response from the uh delegates from the candidates uh for this. So with this course I'm sure that the care for patients presenting to the emergency department across all the hospitals will definitely increase as well as improve uh based on the skills which will be carried forward by the recipients of this course uh after the workshops once they have completed [Music] I've seen a huge crowd assembling here trying to enhance their skills in the ultrasound life support and looking forward for uh such workshops in the future. Uh it was a night's effort by K Barara management. [Music] Ultrasound has become a stethoscope for the emergency physicians. This helps in diagnosing the uncertaintities, providing clinical precision and delaying the decision [Music] [Applause] [Music] delays national ultrasound life support workshop. It basically trains the residents the budding emergency physicians to learn about ultrasound. Why is ultrasound so important is uh it's a basics test you know which you can help which helps us diagnose multiple conditions being just on the bedside and it's not very time consuming and it's cost effective as well. [Music] As you all know, when a patient comes into the emergency department, it's important to have the right doctor at the right place for the right treatment so that you're ensuring that the morbidity and the mortality is reduced. [Music] The ultrasound has become a essential tool for emergency physicians. It's not just limited to the radiologists anymore. So recognizing the importance of this tool, Dr. Ken has composed a well-drafted workshop for the ultrasound for all the emergency physicians and residents across Hyderabad. [Music] coming to ultrasound. uh uh so I'm practicing since last 8 years and the best thing I learned uh as a skill is a ultrasound because in emergency care every time uh there'll be a patient coming to the emergency department you want to diagnose the patient at the [Music] [Applause] earliest. Uh the workshop has been uh really well since morning and all the sessions were very educative, very informative and it is of utmost help. Some of the protocols that we usually follow also are being taught and um the workshop are all hands-on and it's very useful and it's still going on and uh it's very helpful for us.

So by practicing hands-on with ultrasound with the help of ultrasound we are going to treat a patient lot of patients and their outcome also. So definitely this kind of program should be conducted even more and in future also we are expecting even more. Ultrasound is really a emerging tool in emergency medicine and it help in diagnosing the patient in uh within 10 minutes or 15 minutes we can diagnose the patient in emergency uh situations in the department.

Hello everyone. Today we're going to demonstrate how to perform CPR on small babies like a kids and infants. We could say we perform CPR on baby who is in cardiac arrest. So before starting our CPR we should follow certain steps. So like checking whether scene is safe or not. So if seen is not safe you have to take him to the safest place. Then second step is to check the response. Checking the response on baby is bit different from the adults. In case of adults we tap on the shoulders and shout. But in case of small babies we rub on the palms and soul and ear loials. So this is how we are going to check the response. Then third step is you have to call for help activating the emergency systems or activating the ambulance systems or activating the hospitals which are nearby. Then fourth step is again it is a crucial step to check the pulse and breathing simultaneously which is suggested for medical personals. If it is a non-medical personnel we don't suggest because these people will waste their valuable time on checking the pulse. So we don't suggest for the non-medical personals. If you think that baby is not breathing, you think that patient baby is in cardiac arrest and start the CPR? Then if you are alone, then how to do CPR? Then you can use your two fingers to give the chest compressions. So these are my two fingers. I'm going to keep my two fingers on the baby's chest. Same thing which the line joins both the nipples. This is the place where we're going to keep my two fingers and start the chest compressions. Then I have to secure baby's head without nodding. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 25 27 28 29 30. Then two breathing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 that is one technique so there is another technique of doing CPR on babies. So that's called thumb and circle techniques. So you have to keep your both hands around the patient chest. Then start giving the compressions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 then I usually two breathing. So like that we give CPR on babies.

Stay calm. Uh call the emergency services. Don't wait to see when the patient is going to what's going to happen. And if the patient is awake, ask about the poison, how much quantity he has taken, when he was taken. If don't try to induce the warming because it can make the things worsen. If the substance is known, keep it in the container. It helps us to identify the poison. If the patient is unconscious or seizing, try to place the patient in one side and check for the breathing. [Music]

Gagging. So gagging is when the child eat something and partially obstruct. It's the airway but it's completely you can see gagging children gagging pretty often like when they eat and it's partially obstructing that is when you you know you encourage the child to cough more and cool them down. You can see the baby is red here and the eyes are watering. That is when you know it's gagging and do not worry. Please calm down. Encourage the child to cough more. Yes. But if it's choking that is completely obstructing that is how do you know that it's choking? So when the child is choking you have to see that the child is turning blue. He's very still. There are no sounds coming in. That's that's an emergency and you definitely have to intervene. This is when see these are when the patient when a child is like that. So you take in the patient stabilize you sit and then you know hold the child like this stabilize yourself. Okay turn in the child and between the shoulder blades give five breaths like this. Okay. and turn around again between the nipples. Give five breaths. Push in inside and up. That is when the child can, you know, the choking can be released. That is you're providing pressure to spit out whatever he's having. But one thing I'll tell you, never do blind turns like opening the mouth, trying to push it. You will cause harm rather than helping the child. Please make it sure you don't do any blind techniques and no heroism here. Please take the child as much as take take the child to the emergency as soon as possible and if the child is unconscious please start CPR and do the needful please take care of the child and yourself.
